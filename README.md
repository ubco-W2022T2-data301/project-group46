## Topic/Interest Description

This dataset is of particular interest to those exploring the streaming services industry and the offerings of the top providers. It could be used to compare the different services, uncover trends in the offerings, and to track changes over time. With this dataset, one could build a dashboard that allows users to easily compare the offerings of each streaming service and to discover new movies and shows. Additionally, this dataset could be used to explore the impact of changes in offerings over time. For example, one could look at how customer ratings or viewership of particular shows have changed after a title was removed or added to a streaming service.

## Data Set Description

The "Streaming Symphony" created from these four data sets (Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Disney+) provides valuable insights into the movie and TV content on the top streaming platforms. The data sets include show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre, and description. Combining the data sets offers a comprehensive overview of the movies and TV shows offered by the top streaming platforms, making it easier to compare the offerings. The data collected in September 2021 provides a snapshot of the content available on each platform at that time. The data can also be used to analyze trends, over a period of time, in movie and TV show genres across platforms and countries, attached with details about the directors and the cast. With such a wealth of data available, it's clear why the "Streaming Symphony" is such a valuable resource for Data Analysis and Visualization of the world of streaming content.

This dataset is provided by Shivamb and contains information about movies and TV shows from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney, and Hulu. It includes details such as the titles, release dates, ratings, and genres of each show/movie. The data was collected from 2019 to 2021, and includes both current and past titles. The purpose of this dataset is to allow users to explore the different streaming services and to compare the different offerings. The data was collected manually by researching the different streaming services and their offerings. This dataset can be used to compare the different services, discover new shows and movies, and to track the changes in offerings over time.
