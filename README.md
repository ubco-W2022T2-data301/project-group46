## Data Set Description

The "Streaming Symphony" created from these four data sets (Hulu, Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Disney+) provides valuable insights into the movie and TV content on the top streaming platforms. The data sets include show ID, type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre, and description. Combining the data sets offers a comprehensive overview of the movies and TV shows offered by the top streaming platforms, making it easier to compare the offerings. The data collected in September 2021 provides a snapshot of the content available on each platform at that time. The data can also be used to analyze trends, over a period of time, in movie and TV show genres across platforms and countries, attached with details about the directors and the cast. With such a wealth of data available, it's clear why the "Streaming Symphony" is such a valuable resource for Data Analysis and Visualization of the world of streaming content.
