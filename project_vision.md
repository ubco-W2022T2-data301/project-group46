# Project Vision
Our project aims to extract valuable insights from the Kaggle data collection on the streaming industry by analyzing information on show ID, show type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genre, and description. Our vision is to transform raw data into actionable insights, through data analysis and visualization, that provide a comprehensive understanding of the streaming landscape. Through this project, we strive to:
- Uncover the popularity of different genres and how they have evolved over time.

- Compare the features, such as rating, duration, and release year, of each service to determine which one delivers the most value to viewers.

- Analyze the distribution of shows across different countries and determine which countries are most active in the streaming industry.

- Derive a relationship between streaming services and genre popularity, as well as the popularity of each service in different countries to gain a clear understanding of which streaming services are most used for specific genres and in which countries.

Our ultimate goal is to deliver data-driven recommendations that support informed decision-making and drive innovation and growth in the entertainment industry.
